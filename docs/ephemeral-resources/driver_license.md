# secretsmanager_driver_license (Ephemeral Resource)

Use this ephemeral resource to read secrets of type `driverLicense` stored in Keeper Vault.

Unlike data sources, ephemeral resources do not store any secret values in the Terraform state file. The values are only available during the Terraform plan and apply phases, making this a more secure option for accessing sensitive credentials.

## Example Usage

```terraform
ephemeral "secretsmanager_driver_license" "my_license" {
  path = "<record UID>"
}

output "driver_license_number" {
  value     = ephemeral.secretsmanager_driver_license.my_license.driver_license_number
  ephemeral = true
}
```
